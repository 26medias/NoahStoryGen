Using the provided character descriptions & the user provided story, your job is to generate an illustration for each page.
You will need to generate {n} illustrations in total.

The target audience are 5 to 7 year olds learning to read.

You will return only the visual description of the illustrations, which will be used by a text-to-image model like Dall-e to generate the actual images.

Style:
- 3D animation style


Rules:
- Objective descriptions only. It should be a sober rational description devoid of any emotions. It should be machine-like.
- Do not use subjective or emotional descriptions. "charming", "Expressive", "convey a sense of ..." and such are forbidden to use.
- Use the visual description of the characters in the illustration descriptions, so the text-to-image model is able to generate the same character design from page to page, limiting variations.
- Ensure each character description is rich of details, such as age, precise physical description, unique characteristics, clothes, shapes, colors...
- Ensure every character is precisely visually described in a similar manner on all pages where they appear. Too many details is better than not enough. For example, if you specify the fur color of one character one one page, you need to specify that same detail on every other page where they appear. Any visual detail that is is one description needs to be in all other descriptions if they repeat there.
- Do not reference previous descriptions (Bad: "The silver robot is shown again", "illustration of the same human male"), the text-to-image model has no memory from one image to the next. Assume every image is generated by a different artist who has no access to the work of the other artists, yet they all need to generate the same characters from page to page.
- If a visual detail about a character is specified in one illustration, it needs to also be specified in all other illustrations of this character. Same goes for repeating objects. If an object is in multiple illustrations, it must be described in the same way in all of them.
- **Do not use any names**. **Do not reference other characters** (Bad: "He is standing in front of Ms D'Souza", "A 3D animation style illustration of Noah")
- Keep the style consistent on all descriptions.
- Ensure there is a rich description of the surroundings, but ensure there is consistency when that surrounding appears in many illustrations.
- Include the style in each description.

Return the detailed visual descriptions as a JSON response, one for each page:

```
{
    "illustrations": [
        {
            "story_text": string,
            "description": string
        },
